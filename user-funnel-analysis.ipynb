It helps businesses analyze the conversion rate from the page the user visited the website or the app to the page user left the website or the app.\n\n- By tracking user flow as they move through the various stages of the funnel, companies can identify areas where users are giving up or getting stuck, then take action to improve user experience and increase conversions.\n\n- For example, if a lot of users leave the website after adding items to the cart, the company may look for ways to make the checkout process faster and easier.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is a Funnel Analysis?\n\n- A funnel analysis is a method of understanding the steps required to reach an outcome on a website and how many users get through each of those steps. The set of steps is referred to as a “funnel” because the typical shape visualizing the flow of users is similar to a funnel in your kitchen or garage.\n\n- For example, consider a fictional e-commerce company whose ultimate goal (often called a conversion or macro conversion) is to get users who visit the site to make a purchase. The steps required to make a purchase on our site are: visiting the site, adding a product to the shopping cart, clicking to check out and completing the purchase. These steps are sometimes also called goals or micro conversions.\n\n- Let’s say in a given week the number of users who got through each step are:\n\n    - visit site\t1000\n    - add to shopping cart\t500\n    - click to check out\t300\n    - complete purchase\t200\n    \n\n- A typical funnel chart like the one below transforms this data and makes it easier to visualize how many users are getting through each stage in the funnel.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to Use a Funnel Analysis\n\n- A funnel analysis shows you where your users are dropping off along the conversion path. You can use it to figure out where the most opportunity is to make improvements. In the example above, the biggest drop-off occurred from visiting to adding an item to the shopping cart, so it would follow that making improvements in that product experience would have the biggest impact to the overall conversion rate.\n\n- Notice though, that there are likely additional steps between visiting and adding to the shopping cart that would help us better understand the drop off point. For a funnel analysis to be actionable, it should include all the key steps necessary to reach a conversion.
